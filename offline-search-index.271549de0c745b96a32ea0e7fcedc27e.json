[{"body":"View, Edit, and Annotate DNA, RNA, and Protein Sequences DNA, RNA, or protein sequences (Sequence View). The Sequence View is one of the major object views in UGENE designed to visualize and edit DNA, RNA, or protein sequences along with their properties like annotations, chromatograms, 3D models, statistical data, etc. For each file, UGENE analyzes the file content and automatically opens the most appropriate view. To activate the Sequence View, open any file with at least one sequence. For example, you can use the $ugene/data/samples/Genbank/murine.gb file provided with UGENE. After opening the file in UGENE, the Sequence View window appears:\nSequence View - an object view designed to visualize DNA, RNA, or protein sequences along with their properties like annotations, chromatograms, 3D models, statistical data, etc.\nProject View - a visual component used to manage active projects and bookmarks.\nAnnotations Editor - contains tools to manipulate annotations for a sequence.\nOptions Panel - a panel with different information tabs and tabs with settings for Sequence View.\nTask View - shows active tasks, for example, algorithm computations.\nLog View - shows the program log information.\nNotifications - shows notifications for task reports.\nAfter the view is opened, you can see a set of new buttons in the toolbar area. The actions provided by these buttons are available for all sequences opened in the view. These actions are also available from the context menu. Many instruments and algorithms are available:\nFind pattern Find ORFs Find annotated regions Build dotplot Find repeats Find tandems Find restriction sites Primer 3 Find high DNA flexibility regions … Example 1: Finding patterns in your sequence. Do the following steps:\nOpen the ugene/data/samples/murine.gb by the File–\u003eOpen menu, for example. Sequence View with murine.gb opens. Select the Search in Sequence tab of the Options Panel. Click Show more options, and more options appear. Insert, for example, “TTCCGAGGGACACTAGGCTGACTCCATC” pattern into the Search for: field and choose annotation parameters. For example, as in the picture below:\nAfter that, click the Search button. If the pattern is present in the sequence, it appears as new annotation(s):\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"View, Edit, and Annotate DNA, RNA, and Protein Sequences DNA, RNA, or …","ref":"/what-you-can-do-in-ugene/view-edit-and-annotate-dna-rna-and-protein-sequences/","tags":"","title":"View, Edit and Annotate DNA, RNA, and Protein Sequences"},{"body":"What is UGENE?

UGENE Workflow Designer is a central part of UGENE that allows a molecular biologist to create and run complex computational workflows, even if they are not familiar with any programming language.\nA workflow comprises a reproducible, reusable, and self-documented research routine, with a simple and unambiguous visual representation suitable for publications. A workflow can be run both locally and remotely, either using a graphical interface or launched from the command line. Elements in the workflow correspond to algorithms integrated into UGENE. Additionally, you can create custom workflow elements using an integrated scripting language or by connecting arbitrary external command line utilities.\nTo launch the Workflow Designer, select the Tools ‣ Workflow Designer item in the UGENE main menu. The following window appears:\nExample 4: You can find a pattern in a sequence or sequences and save it as annotations using the following workflow:\nCreate the workflow, choose parameters, and click the Run button.
