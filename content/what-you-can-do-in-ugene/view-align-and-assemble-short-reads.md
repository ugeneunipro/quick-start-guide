# View, Align and Assemble Short Reads

**SAM/BAM Files (_Assembly Browser_).** The _Assembly Browser_ is used to visualize and efficiently browse large
next-generation sequence assemblies. Currently, supported formats are SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) and BAM, which is a
binary version of the SAM format. Both formats are produced by SAMtools and are described in the following
specification: SAMtools. To activate the _Alignment Editor_, open any assembly file. For example, you can use the $
_ugene/data/samples/Assembly/chrM.bam_ file provided with UGENE. After opening the file in UGENE, the _Assembly Browser_
window appears:

Using the _Assembly Browser_, you can browse and zoom the assembly, get information about reads, visualize short reads,
associate a reference sequence, produce a consensus sequence, and perform exports.

**Example 3**: Highlighting the strand of reads. You can do this using the context menu or the Options Panel.
