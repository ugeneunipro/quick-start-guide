# View, edit and align multiple sequence alignments

**Multiple sequence alignment (_MSA Editor_).** The _Alignment Editor_ is a powerful tool for visualization and editing DNA, RNA or protein multiple sequence alignments. To activate the _Alignment_ _Editor_ open any alignment ﬁle. For example you can use the $_ugene/data/samples/CLUSTALW/COI.aln_ ﬁle provided with UGENE. After opening the ﬁle in UGENE the _Alignment Editor_ window appears:

The editor supports diﬀerent multiple sequence alignment (MSA) formats, such as ClustalW, MSF and Stockholm. The editor provides interactive visual representation which includes:

*   Navigation through an alignment;
*   Optional coloring schemes (for example Clustal, Jalview like, etc.);
*   Flexible zooming for large alignments;
*   Export publication-ready images of alignment;
*   Several consensus calculation algorithms.

Using the _Alignment Editor_ you can:

*   Perform multiple sequence alignment using integrated MUSCLE and KAlign algorithms;
*   Edit an alignment: delete/copy/paste symbols, sequences and subalignments;
*   Build phylogenetic trees;
*   Generate grid proﬁles;
*   Build Hidden Markov Model proﬁles to use with HMM2/HMM3 tools.

**Example 2**: Build a tree from your alignment. You can do this by three different ways:

a. From the toolbar. Click to the tree icon:

b. From the context menu:

c. From the Options Panel:

After calculation the tree appears in the MSA Editor in a separate window:
