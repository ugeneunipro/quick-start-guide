# View, Edit and Align Multiple Sequence Alignments

**Multiple Sequence Alignment (_MSA Editor_).** The _Alignment Editor_ is a powerful tool for visualizing and editing
DNA, RNA, or protein multiple sequence alignments. To activate the _Alignment Editor_ open any alignment file. For
example, you can use the $_ugene/data/samples/CLUSTALW/COI.aln_ file provided with UGENE. After opening the file in
UGENE, the _Alignment Editor_ window appears:

The editor supports different multiple sequence alignment (MSA) formats, such as ClustalW, MSF, and Stockholm. The
editor provides an interactive visual representation which includes:

* Navigation through an alignment;
* Optional coloring schemes (for example, Clustal, Jalview-like, etc.);
* Flexible zooming for large alignments;
* Exporting publication-ready images of alignment;
* Multiple consensus calculation algorithms.

Using the _Alignment Editor_, you can:

* Perform multiple sequence alignment using integrated MUSCLE and KAlign algorithms;
* Edit an alignment: delete/copy/paste symbols, sequences, and sub-alignments;
* Build phylogenetic trees;
* Generate grid profiles;
* Build Hidden Markov Model profiles to use with HMM2/HMM3 tools.

**Example 2**: Build a tree from your alignment. You can do this in three different ways:

a. From the toolbar. Click on the tree icon:

b. From the context menu:

c. From the Options Panel:

After the calculation, the tree appears in the MSA Editor in a separate window:
