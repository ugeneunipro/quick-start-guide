# Workflow Designer: Pipelines and Repeatable Experiments

**Workflow Designer.** UGENE _Workflow Designer_ is a central part of [UGENE](http://ugene.unipro.ru/) that allows a
molecular biologist to create and run complex computational workflows, even if they are not familiar with any
programming language.

A workflow comprises a reproducible, reusable, and self-documented research routine, with a simple and unambiguous
visual representation suitable for publications. A workflow can be run both locally and remotely, either using a
graphical interface or launched from the command line. Elements in the workflow correspond to algorithms integrated
into [UGENE](http://ugene.unipro.ru/). Additionally, you can create custom workflow elements using an integrated
scripting language or by connecting arbitrary external command line utilities.

To launch the Workflow Designer, select the _Tools â€£ Workflow Designer_ item in the UGENE main menu. The following
window appears:

**Example 4**: You can find a pattern in a sequence or sequences and save it as annotations using the following
workflow:

Create the workflow, choose parameters, and click the _Run_ button. If you want to search for patterns in many
sequences, you can add these sequences into the _Read Sequence_ element. After the process ends, a report appears. The
report includes all information about the workflow.

All your workflows are saved, and you can navigate between them and use them with the help of the _Dashboards Manager:_

Note that workflows in UGENE are easy to read and share, can be reused multiple times, and compiled into separate
standalone command line tools!
