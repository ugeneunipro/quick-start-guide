# What is UGENE?

_**Unipro UGENE**_ is a free cross-platform genome analysis suite. It is distributed under the terms of the GNU General
Public License. To learn more about UGENE, visit the [UGENE website](http://ugene.unipro.ru). It works on Windows, Mac
OS X, or Linux and requires only a few clicks to install.

#### Key Features

* Powerful viewers and editors for DNA and protein sequences, multiple sequence alignments, chromatograms,
  3D-structures, short read assemblies, and phylogenetic trees.
* Support for dozens of data formats, and a set of tools for importing and exporting data.
* Visual designer, runner, and debugger for computational workflows from over 100 embedded algorithmic elements.
* Reusable computational workflows that can be shared, published, and read as plain text by everyone.
* A fully featured command-line version for remote desktops.
* Automatic detection and optimization for multicore hardware, GPGPU, and special instruction sets available on the
  user's PC.
* Setting up the UGENE package automatically gets dozens of tools installed and configured for immediate use.

#### Tools provided with UGENE installation

* BLAST - a popular tool for searching similarities between biological sequences.
* HMMER2/HMMER3 - sequence analysis using profile hidden Markov models, constructed from multiple sequence alignments.
* ClustalW, ClustalO, MUSCLE, Kalign, MAFFT, T-Coffee multiple sequence alignment algorithms.
* Repeat finding and sequence comparison algorithms with convenient dot-plot-based results visualization.
* Open reading frames visualization and export.
* Restriction sites visualization tool with the integrated REBASE database.
* Transcription factor binding sites analysis with SITECON, weight-matrix-based algorithms, and included versions of the
  JASPAR database.
* Short read aligners: BWA, BWA-MEM, Bowtie, Bowtie2, TopHat, etc.
* GC-content, AT-content graphs.
* MrBayes, Phylip, and PhyML tools for phylogenetic tree construction.
* ... and dozens of other popular and highly cited tools.
